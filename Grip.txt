Hello Everyone!
I have completed GRIP Task 6 (Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm) which is a part of Data Science & Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation .
In this video, I created the Decision tree classifier and visualized it graphically. Even if we feed new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. #ml #analytics #dataanalytics
